so now we are talking about your plans ahead
how is it going to be and what you need to carry on your plans
yes, i know that i have talk about this in my journal
but now is the time to make it more rigorous

# Phase 1, 6 months from july to december
it is all about preparation and learning
so better get your brain ready and prepare it to work like a sponge
surely there are setbacks for you to become a data scientist next year
you what that is? you dont have any major title and experience
well, if in this 6 months you can learn all that matters 
so... there will be a chance for it...
or atleast you can have an intership program

the necessary knowledge to learn, for data science:
- basic data science with python
- learn R
- excel and SPSS
- queries SQL,NOSQL databases
- programming skill, java, javascript
- hadoop, apache spark

surely there are a lot of things to learn...
